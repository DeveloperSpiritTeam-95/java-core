    /*
    The Executors framework was introduced in Java 5 as part of the java.util.concurrent package
    to simplify the development of concurrent applications by abstracting away many of the
    complexities involved in creating and managing threads.

    It will help in

    1. Avoiding Manual Thread management
    2. Resource management
    3. Scalability
    4. Thread reuse
    5. Error handling


    Executors Framework is having 3 core interfaces
    They are:
        1. Executor 2. ExecutorService 3. ScheduledExecutorService

        // ExecutorService more on ExecutorServiceExample
        // ScheduleExecutorService more on ScheduleExecutorServiceExample

    }
