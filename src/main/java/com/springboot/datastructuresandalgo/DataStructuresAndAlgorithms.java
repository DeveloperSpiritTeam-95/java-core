        DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms. It is a fundamental concept in computer
        science and programming that helps in solving problems efficiently.

        1. Data Structures (DS)
                Data structures are ways to organize and store data so that they can be accessed
                and modified efficiently.
                Examples include:
            * Arrays – Fixed-size, indexed collection of elements.
            * Linked Lists – A sequence of elements connected by pointers.
            * Stacks – Follows LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
            * Queues – Follows FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
            * Trees – Hierarchical data structure (e.g., Binary Tree, BST).
            * Graphs – A set of nodes connected by edges.
            * Hash Tables – Stores key-value pairs for fast lookups.

        2. Algorithms (A)
                Algorithms are step-by-step procedures to solve problems efficiently.
                Examples include:
            * Sorting Algorithms – Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.
            * Searching Algorithms – Binary Search, Linear Search.
            * Recursion – A function calling itself to solve a problem.
            * Dynamic Programming (DP) – Optimizing solutions by storing previous results
              (e.g., Fibonacci, Knapsack problem).
            * Greedy Algorithms – Making locally optimal choices
              (e.g., Huffman Coding, Dijkstra’s Algorithm).
            * Graph Algorithms – BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, Floyd-Warshall.

         Why is DSA Important?
            Optimized Performance – Helps write efficient code with minimal time and space complexity.
            Competitive Programming – Essential for coding competitions (e.g., CodeForces, LeetCode).
            Job Interviews – Tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft test DSA skills in interviews.
            Problem-Solving – Enhances logical thinking and problem-solving ability.

        Would you like help with learning DSA or practicing problems? 🚀

        OKAY, Let's get started with DSA. Here’s a structured approach:

        Step 1: Learn the Basics
            I). Time and Space Complexity (Big O Notation)
                    Understand how to measure algorithm efficiency.
                    Example:𝑂(1),𝑂(𝑛),𝑂(log𝑛),𝑂(𝑛2)O(1),O(n),O(logn),O(n2).

            II). Basic Data Structures
                    ==> Arrays & Strings (Indexing, Sorting, Searching).
                    ==> Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular).
                    ==> Stacks & Queues (LIFO & FIFO operations).
                    ==> Hashing (Hash Tables, Hash Maps).

        Step 2: Intermediate Topics
            1. Recursion & Backtracking
            2. Sorting & Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Merge Sort, Quick Sort).
            3. Trees & Binary Search Trees (BST) (Traversals: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder).
            4. Graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s Algorithm).

        Step 3: Advanced Topics
            1. Dynamic Programming (DP)
            2. Greedy Algorithms
            3. Tries (Prefix Trees)
            4. Segment Trees & Fenwick Trees

        Step 4: Practice Problems
            --> Start with Easy problems on platforms like LeetCode, CodeChef, or GeeksforGeeks.
            --> Progress to Medium and Hard problems gradually.
            --> Try real-world applications of DSA.
